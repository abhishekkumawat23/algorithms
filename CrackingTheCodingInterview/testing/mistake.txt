Question:
Find the mistake(s) in the following code:
unsigned int i;
for (i = 100; i >= 0; --i)
  printf("%d\n", i);
  
Answer:
1. Error 1:
   a. It will run forever as unsigned i can't become negative. -1 is 11111111111111111111111111111111
   b. Fix: i >= 0 => i > 0 and write one more printf after loop for covering i = 0 part
2. Error 2:
   a. %d is used for unsigned. 
   b. For unsigned, use %u
