Question:
We have the following method used in a chess game: boolean canMoveTo(int x, int y).
This method is part of the Piece class and returns whether or not the piece can move to position (x, y).
Explain how would test this method

Answer:
This is `testing a function` scenario
Step 1: Define test cases
  1. Normal test cases:
     a. Move anywhere except edges
     b. Move camel to diagonals
     c. Move elephants to rows and columns
     d. Move queen in diagonal or row or column
  2. Extreme test cases:
     a. Move to corners
     b. Move to edges
  3. Illegal test cases
     a. Move to invalid point like -2,-3
  4. Strange test cases:
     a. Move to same point where
     b. Move to point where another piece is already present.
     c. Move to a point which is empty but there is no direct way to go there
     d. Move camel in row/column
Step 2: Define test results:
Skipping
Step 3: Write test method
