Question:
You are given the source to an application which crashes when it is run.
After running it ten times in a debugger, you find it never crashes in the same place.
The application is single threaded, and uses only the C standard library.
What programming errors could be causing this crash? how would you test each one?

Answer:
Error can be because of following:
1. Random variable: Random user input, Random number generated by program internally, randomness because of system time
2. Memory leak: memory leak happens and thus crash can happen at any point.
3. External dependencies: Some external dependencies causing it.

While approaching such problems we should go in structured way.
We should find all possible ways and slowly slowly scope the problem and eliminate possible scenarios which can cause issue.
