Important points:
 32 bit vs 64 bit architecture:
 1. In 32 bit, CPU register is of 32 bit.
 2. CPU register 1 bit can address 1 byte of RAM. Thus 32 bit can point to 2^32 different bytes which is 4 GB.
 3. As CPU register can point to 4 GB RAM only, only 4 GB of RAM is usable as CPU register needs to point memory for any processing.
 4. In 64 bit, CPU stores addrees using 64 bit. Thus we don't have any 4 GB limitation.
