Question:
Implement a circularArray class that supports an array-like data structure which can be efficiently rotated.
If possible, the class should use a generic type (also called a template),
and should support iteration via the standard for (Obj o: circularArray) notation

Answer:
We can either rotate the entire array element whenever rotation is required but that is costly OR,
we can just rotate the head pointer.
CircularArray:
CircularArray has head
CircularArray has data which is an array
get(i) - gets element at i index
set(i, e) - sets element at i index
rotate(by) - rotates array by `by` index
convert(i) - convert i index to rotated index
iterator - returns iterator object of circualr array
size - returns size of circular array.

CircularArrayIterator:
CircularArrayIterator has circularArray
CircularArrayIterator has current index
hasNext - returns true if there is next element left to return
next - returns next element
remove - removes current element
