Question:
Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager and director.
An incoming telephone call must be first allocated to a respondant who is free.
If the respondent can't handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to a manager.
If the manager is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalate to a director.
Design the classes and data structures for this problem.
Implement a method dispatchCall() which assigns a call to the first available employee.

Answer:
Step 1: Define core objects
Call
Caller
CallHandlerProgram
JobTitle
Employee
Manager
Respondent
Director

Step 2: Define relationships
Call has caller
Call has handler who is an employee
Call has start time
Call has end time
CallHandlerProgram has list of employees
Employee has jobTitle
Employee has name
Employee has age
Manager is employee with jobTitle as Manager
Respondent is employee with jobTitle as Respondent
Director is employee with jobTitle as Director

Step 3: Define actions
Caller:
makeCall - creates a call and connects the call. Once done, disconnects.

Call:
connect - ask call handler program to dispatch call.
disconnect - disconnects the call.

CallHandlerProgram:
dispatchCall - dispatches a call to free employee, else puts call in queue replying call to wait
assignCall - Keep on checking if employee got free or not. If yes, assign him the call.
escalateCall - dispatches a call to free next level employee.

Employee
recieveCall - recieves call
isFree - checks whether employee is free or not.
