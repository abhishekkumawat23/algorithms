Question:
Design and implement a text based minesweeper game.
Minesweeper is a classic single player computer game where a NxN grid has B mines(or bombs) hidden across the grid.
The remaining cells are either blank or have a number behind them.
The numbers reflect the number of bombs in the surroinding eight cells.
The user then unconvers a cell. If its a bomb, the player loses.
If it is a number, the number is exposed.
If it is a blank cell, this cell and all adjacent blank cells (up to and including the surrounding numeric cells) are exposed.
The player wins when all non-bomb cells are exposed.
The player cna also flag certain places as potential bombs.
This doesn't affect game play, other than the user from accidently clicking a cell that is thought to have a bomb.

Cell:
Cell has x for x position
Cell has y for y position
Cell has value
Cell has isBomb flag
Cell has isExposed flag
Cell has isGuess flag. Player can set it to true if thinks this cell is bomb.
getValue - returns value
expose - exposes the cell value
isExposed - returns true if cell is exposed.
isBomb - returns true if cell is bomb
toggleGuess - change the isGuess value.
isGuess - returns true is cell is guessed as bomb.
getX - gets x position
getY - gets y position

Board:
Board has array of array of cells
Board has noOfUnexposedCells
initialize - initialize all cells
playCell - Plays the cell. If found bomb, send result as lost otherwise successful.
toggleGuess(i, j) - sets the cell at i, j to be a bomb
expandBlankAreas(i, j) - expand blank areas started from blank i, j position

Game:
Game has board
Game has player
startGame - starts the game in loop until lost or won

Player:
Player has name
playCell  plays a cell
