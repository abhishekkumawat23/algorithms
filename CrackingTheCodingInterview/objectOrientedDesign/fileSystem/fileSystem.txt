Question:
Explain the data structures and algorithms that you would use to design an in-memory file system.
Illustrate with an example in code where possible.

Assuming entry as base of file and directories

Entry is an abstract class as it should be either file or directory.
Entry:
Entry has name
Entry has size
Entry has parent which is a directory
Entry has createdTime
Entry has lastUpdatedTime
Entry has lastAccessedTime
size - gets size of entry. It's abstract
getParent - gets parent directory
getCreatedTime - gets created time
getLastAccessedTime - gets last accessed time
getLastUpdatedTime - gets last updated time
delete - deletes entry. returns false if unable to.
getFullPath - gets full path of entry
getName - gets name of entry
changeName - changes name of entry

Directory extends Entry:
Directory has list of entries
size - gets size of directory
deleteEntry - deletes the child entry
addEntry - adds entry in directory
getNumberOfFiles - gets number of files.
getEntries - gets entries of directory

File extends Entry:
File has content
getContent - gets content
setContent - sets content
size - gets size
