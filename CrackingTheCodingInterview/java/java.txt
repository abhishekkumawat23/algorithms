Important points:
1. We can create functions without belonging to any class using lambda functions. This is the only current way where Java is functional programming.

Overloading vs Overriding:
1. Overloading: same name but differ in type or no of arguments
2. Overriding: method shares same name and function signature as another method in its super class.
