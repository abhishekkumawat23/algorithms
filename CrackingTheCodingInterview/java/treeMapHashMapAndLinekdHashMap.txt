Question:
Explain the differences between TreeMap, HashMap and LinkedHashMap

Answer:
HashMap:
1. HashMap is arrayList of linkedList.
2. O(1) time complexity

TreeMap:
1. TreeMap is implemented using red-black tree.
2. We can iterate breadth first to get the sorted order of keys.
3. O(logn)
4. Use it when we need to get the keys in sorted/natural order. Example, map of name to person object. Here we might want to get the persons in sorted order.

LinkedHashMap:
1. LinkedHashMap is implemented using doubly linked buckets.
2. We can get the keys in its insertion orde.r
3. O(1) because we store hashMap of key to node. And nodes form a linked list.
4. Use it when insertion order is important. Example in a caching situation, we want to delete the oldest item.
