Question:
What's the difference between a thread and a process?

Answer:
Process:
1. Process is an instance of a program in execution.
2. A process is an independent entity to which the system resources (CPU time and memory) are allocated.
3. Each process is executed in a separate address space, and one process can't access the variable and data structures of another process.
4. If a process wishes to access another process' resources, inter-process communication have to be used. These  include pipes, files, sockets etc.

Thread:
1. A thread exists within a process and shares the process' resources (including its heap space).
2. Multiple threads within the same process shares same process heap. This is different from processes, which cannot directly access the memory of other processes.
3. Each thread still has its own registers and its own stack, but other threads can read and write the heap memory.
