Question:
What is the significance of keyword `volatile` in C?

Answer:
1. If a variable is volatile, then this means that varibale can be changed by outside like another thread, operating system.
2. As value can be changed unexpectedly by from anywhere, the compiler will therefore reload the value each time from memory whenever accessed.
3. This means that the thread will not store a local copy of the object and will refer to main memory every time object is accessed.
4. Example:
   a. Volatile integer: int volatile x; OR volatile int x;
   b. Pointer to volatile integer: volatile int * x; OR int volatile * x;
   c. Volatile pointer to non-volatile integer: int * volatile x;
   d. Volatile pointer to volatile integer: int volatile * volatile x;
5. Volatile variable are used when multil-threaded programs have global variables and any thread can modify these shared variables.
