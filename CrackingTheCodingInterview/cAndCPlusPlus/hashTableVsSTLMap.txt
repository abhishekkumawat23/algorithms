Question:
Compare and contrast a hash table and an STL map.
How is a hash table implemented?
If the number of inputs is small, which data structure options can be used insteda of a hash table.

Answer:
HashTable:
1. Same as Java.
2. Uses hash function to store key value pairs at particular index.
3. Collisions are handled via linked list chaining.
4. Insertion and lookup happens in amortized O(1) assuming less collisions.

STL map:
1. Balanced binary search tree.
2. Insertions and lookup happens in O(logn)

What can be used instead of a hashTable, if the number of inputs is small.
1. HashTable is used because of O(1) time.
2. So if we can't use hashTable, we should choose data structure which takes very less insertion and lookup time.
3. Best match is STL map which takes O(logn) for these operations.
