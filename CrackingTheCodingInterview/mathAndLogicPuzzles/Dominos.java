 * There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off.
 * You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares.
 * Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board?
 * Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing  why it's impossible)

	/**
	 * Answer:
	 * Both diagonal corners are of same color. lets say black.
	 * So finally there will be 30 blacks and 32 whites.
	 * A domino can exactly cover one black and one white.
	 * So, 31 dominos can exactly cover 31 black and 31 whites.
	 * So, its not possible to cover cheeseboard using 31 dominos.
