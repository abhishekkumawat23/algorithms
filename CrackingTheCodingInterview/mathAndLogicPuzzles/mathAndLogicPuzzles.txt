Prime numbers:
1. 1 is not a prime number.
2. Every positive integer can be decomposed into product of primes.
   Example: 84 = 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^0 * 7^1 * 11^0 * 13^0 * ...
3. If x = 2^j0 * 3^j1 * 5^j2 * ... and y = 2^k0 * 3^k1 * 5^k2 * ..., then
   a. gcd = 2^min(j0,k0) * 3^min(j1,k1) * 5^min*j2,k2) * ...
   b. lcm = 2^max(j0,k0) * 3^max(j1,k1) * 5^max*j2,k2) * ...
4. As we know that, max(x1,x2)*min(x1,x2), So gcd*lcm = x*y

Find if number is prime:
1. 2 is the only prime number which is even.
2. So, to find if number is prime, following are the approches:
   a. Go till n-1: iterate from 2 to n-1 and find if n is divisible by any number
   b. Go till n/2: iterate from 2 to n/2
   c. Go till sqrt(n): iterate from 2 to sqrt(n)
   d. Go till sqrt(n) but check only odd numbers: iterate from 3 to sqrt(n) but check only odd numbers.

Generate list of primes till n- Sieve of eratosthenes
1. Store a boolean array till n/2. Name this array `Prime`. This array will store true if element is prime.
2. This array will contain values 3, 5, 7, .. n i.e. only add numbers after 2. This is because except all primer numbers are ood. 
3. Set all values of prime array as true.
3. Start from array first element whose value is true and set all values divisible by that prime number as false.
4. Next prime number will be the one whose flag value is still true.
5. Iterate till sqrt(n).
6. At the end, return 2, Prime array to return prime list till n.

Probability of A and B and Probability of A or B:
1. P(A and B) = P(B given A)*P(A) = P(A given B)*P(B)
   Example: For x from 1 to 10, P(x is even and x <= 5) = P(x is even given x <= 5)*P(x <= 5) = (2/5)*(1/2) = 1/5
2. P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
   Example: For x from 1 to 10, P(x is even or x <= 5) = P(x is even) - P(x <= 5) + P(x is even and x <= 5) = 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/5 = 4/5 

Independant events and mutual exclusive events:
1. Independant events are not effected by occurence of each other i.e. P(A and B) = P(A) + P(B) i.e. P(A given B) = P(A)
2. Mutual exclusive events are the ones which can't happen together i.e P(A and B) = 0 i.e. P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
